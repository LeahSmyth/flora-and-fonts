    <h3>...is for Vinca Minor</h3>
    
    <p>Vinca Minor, the &ldquo;dwarf periwinkle&rdquo;, is one of the groundcovers. In general, however, the plant is also referred to as &ldquo;lesser periwinkle&rdquo; or &ldquo;myrtle&rdquo;. With its long stolons it covers even large areas and forms beautiful, blue-violet flowers. The plant is not only available in blue-violet, but also in many other colours.</p>
    
    <p>Victorian flower language users assigned it the meaning of a beautifully blossoming friendship. It also means sharing the recollection of a pleasant memory from the past. In the Ukraine, it's tied to folklore about love that lasts through the eternity.</p>
