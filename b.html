    <h3>...is for Baskervville</h3>
    
    <p>Baskervville is a revival of Jacob&rsquo;s revival of Baskerville&rsquo;s typeface. It was distributed by the Berger-Levrault Foundry. The font Jacob produced was sold as a Baskerwille.</p>
    
    <p>The particularity of Jacob&rsquo;s Baskerwille is that the roman is very close to Baskerville&rsquo;s typefaces while the italic is closer to Didot&rsquo;s typefaces.</p>
    
    <p>Baskervville is designed by ANRT (Atelier National de Recherche typographique) students.</p>
    
    <p>Font available from <a class="download-link" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baskervville" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>.</p>

    <h3>...is for Bluebell</h3>
    
    <p>The UK is home to about half of the world&rsquo;s Bluebell population. Bluebells are woodland plants but also grow in hedgerows and grassland. Bluebells are now protected from illegal commercial harvesting.</p>
    
    <p>Bluebells flower in colours ranging from white (quite common), through to grey, pale blue, lilac to dark cobalt. There is also a variegated form with flowers that look as though they are white-bells dipped in blue water-colour paint.</p>
    
    <p>In the Language of Flowers, Bluebells symbolises everlasting love and generation.</p>
