    <h3>...is for Ibarra Real Nova</h3>
    
    <p>This project included the recovery of the types designed by Geronimo Gil for the edition of the most beautiful &ldquo;Quixote&rdquo; never edited, printed by Joaqu&iacute;n Ibarra for the &ldquo;Real Academia de la Lengua&rdquo; in 1780. This font was called &ldquo;Ibarra Real&rdquo;.</p>
    
    <p>Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Ribagorda decided in 2015 that Octavio Pardo would be the first collaborator to play the design. Octavio was the first student of the University of Reading MA Typeface Design program to study this project.</p>

    <h3>...is for Iris</h3>
    
    <p>Iris is a genus of 260â€“300 species of flowering plants with showy flowers, a popular garden flower.</p>
    
    <p>It takes its name from the Greek word for a rainbow, which is also the name for the Greek goddess of the rainbow. Some authors state that the name refers to the wide variety of flower colours found among the many species.</p>
    
    <p>The primary significances of the Iris flower are: faith, hope, wisdom, courage, and admiration. With striking uniqueness and beauty, Irises have rich meanings, and when given as gifts, they can convey deep sentiments.</p>
