    <h3>...is for Merriweather</h3>
    
    <p>Merriweather was designed to be a text face that is pleasant to read on screens. It features a very large x height, slightly condensed letterforms, a mild diagonal stress, sturdy serifs and open forms.</p>
    
    <p>The Merriweather project is led by Sorkin Type, a type design foundry based in Western Massachaussets, USA.</p>

    <h3>...is for Windflower</h3>
    
    <p>A Windflower, commonly known as the Wood Anemone, Smellfox, or Crowfoot, is a species of the genus Anemone. The flower has no honey and little scent, and apparently relies little on the visits of insects for the fertilization of its one-celled seed-vessels.</p>
    
    <p>Windflowers are a group of perennials with colourful poppy-like flowers that flutter in the breeze. Flower colour varies widely, but the blossoms are generally two to three inches in diameter with thin, delicate petals.</p>
    
    <p>The Windflower flower symbolises protection against evil and ill wishes. Forsaken or forgotten love and affection.</p>
