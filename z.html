    <h3>...is for Zilla Slab</h3>
    
    <p>Zilla Slab is Mozilla&rsquo;s core typeface, used for the Mozilla wordmark, headlines and throughout their designs.</p>
    
    <p>A contemporary slab serif, based on Typotheque&rsquo;s Tesla, it is constructed with smooth curves and true italics, which gives text an unexpectedly sophisticated industrial look and a friendly approachability in all weights.</p>
    
    <p>Designed by Typotheque, this project is led by Mozilla.</p>
    
    <p>Font available from <a class="download-link" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Zilla+Slab" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>.</p>

    <h3>...is for Zephyranthes</h3>
    
    <p>Zephyranthes also known as Rain Flower, Rain Lily, and Zephyr Lily. The name is derived from Zephyrus, the Greek god of the west wind, and anthos, meaning flower, referring to the slender stalks.</p>
    
    <p>In mild climates the pink Rain Lily is used as a landscape plant for its attractive foliage and big flowers. The flowers open out flat at midday and close in the afternoon. Although each flower only lasts one to a few days, there can be multiple flushes of blooms throughout the season.</p>
